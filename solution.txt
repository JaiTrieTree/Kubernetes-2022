CONFIGURATION: Ubuntu 2022 VM running on VMWare Fusion on MacOS Intel fully patched
*	calico network plugin does not allow proper access from pods
	-	apk add curl --update fails from an alpine pod
	-	wget http://cn.cern.io fails from busybox pod
	- 	networkpolicy does work
*	after replaceing the calico plugin with the weave plugin using kubectl apply -f https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/releases/download/v2.8.1/weave-daemonset-k8s.yaml
	-	apk add curl --update works from alpine pod
	-	networkpolicy does not work
CONFIGURATION: Fedora Core 36 VM running on VMware Fustion on MacOS Intel fully patched
*	calico network plugin does nog handle the netwerkpolicy correctly and allows traffic even if labels are unset

To test networkpolicy, use https://github.com/sandervanvugt/ckad/nwp-complete-example.yaml.
After installation of this, kubectl exec -it busybox -- wget --spider --timeout=1 nginx is supposed to fail, it doesn't. 

Observed behavior: firewall module in Ubuntu OS reports problems
